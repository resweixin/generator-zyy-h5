## ISSUE

**node-sass installation failed Solution**: because the installation of `node-sass` when it github Releases are hosted in the file `s3.amazonaws.com` above, and this site is always in the country network is not Stable, so we use `cnpm` , `yarn` or Taobao mirror to download this file.

Directly run the following command

```
SASS_BINARY_SITE=https://npm.taobao.org/mirrors/node-sass/ npm install node-sass && npm install gulp-sass
```
